what about a modal keybinding setup for sxhdc?

super, super => Navigation mode
    any {motion} can be used to focus a window in
    navigation mode.

    {motion}:
        w => current window

        h => left of focus
        j => down of focus
        k => up of focus
        l => right of focus

        same as command => workspace
        { => left of current workspace
        } => right of current workspace

 
v{motion}{method} => preview / screenshot tool

    {method}:
        p => preview what was grabbed
        y => put what was grabbed to clipboard
        another mode => exit this mode without doing anything

r => resize mode
    resize current window using motion keys

i => focus mode

f => find a window in the dekstop

a => append window to bin tree via depth first
    like this:

                DESK
                 /\
                /  \
               /    \
              /      \
             /		  \
           WORK1	 WORK2
            /         /\
           /         /  \
        GROUP      WIN3 WIN4
         / \
       WIN NEWWIN

o => append window via breadth first
    like this

                DESK
                 /\
                /  \
               /    \
              /      \
             /        \
          WORK1     WORK2
           /\         /\
          /  \       /  \
        WIN  NEWWIN WIN3 WIN4

    all append commands will work only on the workspace focused

y{motion} => screenshot tool, no preview given

d{motion} => deletes window relative to {motion}

top bar - bottom bars are for editors
